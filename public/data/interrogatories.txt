Interrogatories:
An interrogatory is a written question used in legal proceedings.
It can be general and cover a wide range of topics.
Interrogatories are often part of the discovery process in a lawsuit.
They help gather information from the opposing party.
Examples of interrogatories:
“Describe the events leading up to the incident.”
“List all witnesses to the accident.”
Special Interrogatories:
A special interrogatory is also a written question.
It is more specific and tailored to the case.
Special interrogatories focus on particular issues relevant to the lawsuit.
Unlike form interrogatories, they are customized for the specific situation.
Examples of special interrogatories:
“Provide details about the contract signed on June 15, 2022.”
“Explain the basis for your claim of damages.”
In summary, while both types serve similar purposes, special interrogatories are more targeted and case-specific, whereas regular interrogatories can cover a broader range of topics. 

Subparts:
Subparts refer to multiple components within a single question.
For example, if an interrogatory asks, “List all the witnesses, their addresses, and their phone numbers,” it contains subparts (witnesses, addresses, and phone numbers).
Compound Question:
A compound question combines two or more distinct inquiries into one.
For instance, “Explain your actions during the incident and provide any relevant documents” is a compound question because it asks for both an explanation and documents.
Conjunctive Question:
A conjunctive question uses the word “and” to connect multiple conditions.
For example, “Did you witness the accident and take any photographs?” is a conjunctive question because it combines witnessing and photograph-taking.
Disjunctive Question:
A disjunctive question uses the word “or” to present alternative options.
For instance, “Did you attend the meeting or submit a written report?” is a disjunctive question because it offers two distinct choices.
In summary, special interrogatories must be straightforward, without subparts, and cannot be compound, conjunctive, or disjunctive. This ensures clarity and simplicity in legal questioning.
